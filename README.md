# Single layer neural network with Numpy

Build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! Concepts coded with Numpy include gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know. 

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

Part of the Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree.
